# Simple NFT Indexer

This is an skeleton app with [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/)for styling that uses the [Alchemy SDK](https://www.alchemy.com/sdk) rigged to Alchemy's Enhanced APIs in order to display all of an address's ERC-721 tokens, including a call to any `image` attached to their metadata.

## Set Up

1. Install dependencies by running `npm install`
2. Start application by running `npm run dev`

## Challenge

Fork this repo and build out more features! This is minimalistic on purpose.

We purposefully built this out to be a skeleton version of what can be the next big thing so that you can practice some software development! Here are a few challenge suggestions:

1. Add Wallet integration so that any user that connects their wallet can check see their NFTs in a flash![x]
2. There is no indication of a request in progress... that's bad UX! Do you think you can add some sort of indication of loading?[x]
3. Add some styling! üé® [x]
4. The NFT images can sometimes appear and sometimes not... can you think of ways to fix that?[]
5. There is no error-checking for wrongly formed requests, or really any error checking of any kind... can you add some in?[x]
6. The images and grid display could look better... anything you can do about that?[]
7. There are ways to make this app faster... can you implement some of them? How can the query be made _even_ quicker?[]
8. Can you add ENS support for inputs?[]
9. The code has no commenting... bruh! Clear documentation is a clear path for other developers to understand and build on your code... think you can add clear commenting?[x]
10. Completely open-ended!! Use this as the base for your next hackathon project, dream company or personal expedition []

## NFT Indexer

Now that you've learned about the ERC-721 token standard, we've packaged up a skeleton application written using [Vite + React](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

Here at AU, we love using an awesome front-end component library called [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/). This app uses a bunch of Chakra! üî•

First time hearing of Chakra? We recommend reading [this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/why-should-you-start-using-chakraui/#:~:text=Chakra%20UI%20is%20a%20component,with%20some%20other%20libraries%20too.) explaining ChakraUI and why it's a very powerful tool for front-end developers to learn!

This skeleton application uses the [Alchemy SDK](https://www.alchemy.com/sdk) in order to instantly return ALL the ERC-20 token balances of an address. Woah! üî•

Thanks to the Alchemy SDK, you can do this blazingly fast. This is because the Alchemy SDK is rigged directly to Alchemy's own [getNFTs](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/getnfts) endpoint.

This is an extremely powerful API! Can you imagine what a headache it would be to acquire ALL of the NFTs of an address otherwise?? You would need to manually:

1. go through EVERY block in the blockchain
2. go through EVERY tx in every block,
3. index each tx,
4. see whether the tx involves any ERC-721 specific events
5. then, build up your own database

That‚Äôs super difficult!! Thanks to Alchemy's [Enhanced APIs](https://www.alchemy.com/enhanced-apis), this is no longer a burden on the developer.

Set this app up and see for yourself, you'll be able to query anyone's entire NFT collection in a few seconds flat! üèé

The NFT indexer app you will set up below uses a powerful combination of the following Alchemy Enhanced API endpoints:

[getNfts](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/getnfts)
[getNftMetadata](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/getnftmetadata)
